**A while back on Twitter,** I read through (and have since lost) a thread of data scientists arguing whether they should be able to code from scratch the algorithms they use. I was surprised to find that many did not feel that this capability was necessary. Needless to say, I think it *is* necessary. Common data science algorithms are not black boxes, and the ability to implement them with code comes hand in hand with the ability to recognize an algorithm's limitations. This is not to say that data scientists should divert to coding basic algorithms from scratch for every project. That would be absurd, especially when so much work has been done to develop highly optimized data science tools. 

### This repo serves as a storage space for algorithms I commonly use, Python packages I'd like to break down, and algorithms I'd like to understand better.
